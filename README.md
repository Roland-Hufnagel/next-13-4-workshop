# Art Gallery Next.js 13 Challenge

Here you find a static Art Gallery App. Your job is to add interactivity:

- Fetch real data from the API instead of using the hard coded data. You can use the function provided in [/lib/fetchArtPieces.js](./lib/fetchArtPieces.js)
- Make the favorite buttons work, so that users can mark / unmark art pieces as favorites. Use localStorage to persist which pieces are favorites.
- Make the favorite page only show the favorite pieces.
- Make the details page show the details of the correct art piece.
- Make the comment form work and persist comments in localStorage.
- Make sure the details page gets statically generated at build time for all art pieces.
- Make the spotlight page show a random art pieces every time the user navigates to the page.
